\f0\fs24 \cf0 These are temperature measurements for several pits dug in March and April, 2020 on Grand Mesa, Colorado.\
\
The naming convention is as follows\
<Site Abbreviation>_<Open or Trees>_<AM or PM>_<Date (mmddyy)>_<Time (00:00, 24hr)>\
\
Site Abbreviation Codes\
	cl: county line\
	mw: mesa west\
	sw: skyway\
\
Open or Trees\
	o: open\
	t: trees\
\
The first 12 lines are site metadata, including location name, location type (open or trees), northing, easting, surveyor name (which are all me :)), time, time type (am or pm), air temperature, height of snow (Hs), ground cover, notes on the pit location, and weather notes (Wx).\
\
Starting at line 14, columns (including header) for the temperatures start, beginning at the snow surface. For example, if Hs is 101, this is 101 cm above the ground, at the surface of the snow. Then, temperatures are taken at 10cm increments until the ground (0cm). \
\
An NA in temperature measurement likely means that there was vegetation in the way of temperature measurement.}
