    "*Steven to Amy Steiker / Steve Tanner*: Q: a lot of the snowex data on NSIDC right now are \"level 0\" raw data. what would it look like to create a \"level 1\" product that's gone through a QA/QC process or even a merger of multiple level 0 products; A: That's basically up to the PI's themselves.  As they produce and submit higher level products, we are publishing them.  That kind of higher-level production is not something the DAAC's themselves do. For SnowEx though, I think some of the \"Raw\" data is fairly well behaved, so you might want to take a look at those and see if they are useful in their current state. I should note that SnowEx PIs have been using \"Raw\" in a bit different sense than what NASA typically means by \"Level 0\", so don't equate the two terms relative to SnowEx products."
